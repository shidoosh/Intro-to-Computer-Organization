A. The conditional statement always succeeds because of the substraction 
operation with an operand of type int, maxbytes, and calling the function sizeofthat returns size_t, which is unsigned. Thus, the whole operation will always
have an unsigned result, thus always satisfying the conditional such that the 
result will never be less than 0. 

B. By using comparison operators and exploiting the fact that sizeof will never return anything less than zero, we can fix the conditional statement to desired performance, like so:  if(sizeof(val)<=maxbytes).
